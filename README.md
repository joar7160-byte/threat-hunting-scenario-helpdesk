## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Log Analytics Workspaces (Microsoft Azure)  
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

## Scenario
In early October 2025, several **intern and employee machines** in the Helpdesk department began showing suspicious behavior. Multiple systems executed programs directly from their **Downloads** directories — an abnormal pattern for enterprise devices. These executables shared similar names such as *desk*, *help*, *support*, and *tool*, indicating a deceptive “Helpdesk Utility” lure designed to trick users into running malicious files.

The investigation aimed to **identify the initial point of compromise**, **analyze attacker behavior across stages**, and **eradicate persistence mechanisms** used to maintain access within the environment.  

---

## High-Level IoC Discovery Plan
- Check **DeviceProcessEvents** to identify the suspicious machine, execution chain, and reconnaissance activity.  
- Check **DeviceFileEvents** to locate tampering, artifact creation, and planted narrative files.  
- Check **DeviceNetworkEvents** to track outbound communication and exfiltration attempts.  

---

## Starting Point
The issue began in the first half of October. Using **DeviceProcessEvents**, we searched for any executables launched from the Downloads folder that contained helpdesk-related keywords. This helped pinpoint the most suspicious endpoint for deeper investigation.

`````kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-01) .. datetime(2025-10-16))
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "Download"
| where ProcessCommandLine matches regex @"(?i)(desk|help|support|tool).*\.exe"

`````

Question: Identify the most suspicious machine based on the given conditions.
Answer: gab-intern-vm

🚩 1. Initial Execution Detection
Once the suspicious host was identified, we searched for the first instance of PowerShell execution to determine when malicious code first ran.

`````kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-01) .. datetime(2025-10-16))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "powershell"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, ProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated asc
`````

Question: What was the first CLI parameter name used during execution?
Answer: -ExecutionPolicy

🚩 2. Defense Disabling
We then checked if any tampering attempts occurred on the compromised host by searching for files referencing tamper.

`````kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-01) .. datetime(2025-10-15))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where FileName matches regex @"(?i)(tamper)"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath
| order by TimeGenerated asc
`````

Question: What was the name of the file related to this exploit?
Answer: DefenderTamperArtifact.lnk

🚩 3. Quick Data Probe
Next, we looked for commands that accessed clipboard data — a common quick-data theft tactic.

`````kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-01) .. datetime(2025-10-15))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where FileName contains "powershell"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "clip"
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated asc
`````

Question: Point out when the last recon attempt occurred.
Answer: 2025-10-09T12:51:44.3425653Z

🚩 5. Storage Surface Mapping
After session recon, the attacker enumerated available drives and shares.

`````kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-01) .. datetime(2025-10-15))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
